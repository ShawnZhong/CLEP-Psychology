# 13. Statistics, Tests and Measurements (Ch2)

### 13.1 Descriptive and Inferential Statistics Samples, populations, norms

- Statistics
	- collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of numeric data
- Samples
	- representative subset of larger population
	- random sample
- Populations
	- group of people looking to study
- Norms
	- identifying normal behavior of group to compare to
	- standardizing
- Descriptive Statistics
	- used for correlational and experimental designs
	- measurements of behavior from sample
- Mean
	- average
- Mode
	- most commonly occurring score
- Median
	- middle score, separates lower and upper halves of scores
- Standard Deviation
	- statistical measure of how much scores in a sample vary around the mean
	- higher SD = more variability (more spread)
	- lower SD = less variability (less spread)
- Normal Distribution
	- bell curve showing symmetrical alignment of two variables (e.g Intelligence)
- Inferential Statistics
	- inferences about population based on characteristics of sample
- statistical significance
	- not likely to have happened by chance
	- significant equals 5% of the time or less

### 13.2 Reliability and Validity

- Reliability

  - stability and consistency of scores
  - does not need to be valid to be reliable

- Types of Reliability

  - test-retest reliability

  ![Image result for test-retest reliability](assets/characteristics-of-a-good-test-12-638.jpg)

  - internal consistency
  	- How well does a test correlate with itself
  - split-half reliability
  	- Cronbach’s alpha: avg correlation for every way a test can be split in half

- Validity

  - how well a test measures what it is supposed to measure
  - must be reliable to be valid

- Types of validity

  - face/content validity
  	- whether a test looks as though it is measuring what it is supposed to measure
  - predictive validity
  	- how well scores on the test predict the actual behavior of the type that the test is supposed to measure
  - construct validity
  	- whether the scores on a questionnaire are related in expected ways, either positively or negatively, to scores on other questionnaires that are proposing to measure the same thing.

- standardizing measures

### 13.3 Types of Tests

- Tests used to rule out chance
- t-test: computed for two means to see if they come from same population (e.g., of two groups or variables)
- ANOVA: analysis of variance

- Pearson correlation coefficient (-1.0 to +1.0)

### 13.4 Measurement of Intelligence

- Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale
  - first IQ test
  - still widely used today
  - norming and standardization

- Wechsler Intelligence Tests
  - WAIS- IV: Adult
  - WISC-V: Children
  - WPPSI-IV: Pre-school and primary school

- Flynn effect
  - each generation, higher IQ
