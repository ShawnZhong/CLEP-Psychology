# 8. Developmental Psychology (Ch 9)

### 8.1 Research Methods: Longitudinal, Cross-sectional, Cross-sequential

- Cross-sectional

	- comparing people of **different ages** at same point in time
	- similarities due to context of a cohort can confound findings

	![A chart shows an example of a cross-sectional design. The year is 2004 and three separate cohorts are included in a study. Participants in Cohort "A" are two tears old. Participants in Cohort "B" are six years old. Participants in Cohort "C" are eight years old.](assets/original-20180719142905106.png)

- Longitudinal

	- tracking **single cohort (age group)** over **long period of time**
	- lose participants due to life circumstances or drop out
		- threatens validity of study

	![Chart of a longitudinal research design. Child "A" is first observed in 2004 at the age of two. Child "A' is next observed in 2006 at age four. The next observation is in 2008 when Child "A" is six. Finally, in 2010 at the age of eight Child "A" is observed again.](assets/original-20180719142851428.png)

- Cross-sequential

	- people of **different ages** (like cross-sectional) are followed over **long periods of time** (like longitudinal)
	- helps to **reduce confounding variables**

	![A chart of a sequential design: The study begins in 2002 with Cohort "A" who are two years old. The study continues in 2004. Cohort "A" are now fours years old. They are joined in the study by Cohort "B" who are two years old. The final year of the study is 2006. Cohort "A" is six years old, Cohort "B" is four years old, and third cohort is added, Cohort "C" who are two years old.](assets/original-20180719142915413.png)

### 8.2 Theories of development

- Piaget’s theory of cognitive development

  - sensorimotor: 0-2

    - knowledge through the **senses**
    - gradually acquire **object permanence**
  - pre-operational: 2-6

    - egocentric
    - use **symbolic thought**: words, images
    - **inability to understand conservation**
  - concrete operations: 6-12
  	- **logical** rules for concrete problems
  - formal operations: 12 +
  	- thinks **scientifically** and **hypothetically** about abstract principles

- Freud’s Psychosexual Theory

	- Oral: 0-1

		- **mouth** pleasure center-sucking reflex

	- Anal: 1-3

		- learn to control **bodily functions**
		-  toilet training

	- Phallic: 3-6

		-  sexual instincts subside
		- develop **superego** and conscious

	- Genital: 12+

		- **sexual impulses** reemerge

### 8.3 Dimensions of development: physical, cognitive, social, moral

- Physical

  - Infancy to childhood
  	- 5-7 lbs and 2-3 inches per year
  	- brain: 55% at age 2→ 90% at age 6
  	- motor development
  - Adolescence
  	- maturing of adrenal and sexual glands
  	- rapid increase in height
  	- menarche and spermarche
  - Adulthood
  	- Early - physical maturation complete
  	- Middle - gradual physical decline
  	- Late - last stages of physical change

- Cognitive

  - Infancy to childhood
  	- significant development of **cognitive abilities** and **thought processes**
  	- **language** and **communication** skills: partially inborn, partially learned
  - Adolescence
  	- more complex abilities: **processing speed and efficiency**
  	- more capable of **abstract** **thought**
  	- cognitive **empathy**
  - Adulthood
  	- complex, ever changing
  	- crystallized intelligence
  	- late: decline in fluid intelligence

- Social

  - Infancy to childhood

    - attachment theory by Bowlby:  avoidant, resistant, disorganized, secure

    - Sense of self and parenting style: authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, uninvolved

    ![Image result for authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, uninvolved](assets/1095045-article-types-of-parenting-styles-5a7cb6aaa18d9e00362ef5eb.png)

    ![Image result for authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, uninvolved](assets/parenting-style-v-21.jpg)

  - Adolescence

  	- form identity, pull away from parents
  	- peer relationships become central focus
  	- Social media

  - Adulthood

  	- need to have and find meaning
  	- define oneself based on career
  	- familial relationships central focus

- Moral: Kohlberg's stages of moral development

	- Infancy: right and wrong-what **feels good or bad**
	- Toddler: right and wrong-what **they are told by others**
	- Preschool: internalize **family values**, consequences of behaviors
	- 7-10: strong sense of “**should**” and “**should not**”
	- Preteen/teen: reason **abstractly** “right” and “wrong”, aware of larger society

	- gender dysphoria
		- discomfort identifying with one’s biological sex
		- 6 months (DSM 5)

### 8.5 Heredity-environment issues

- Nature/Heredity
	- all genes and hereditary factors influence who we are
	- characteristics and traits are product of evolution
- Nurture/Environment
	- everything we are and know is based on experience
	- **behaviorism**: all or most behaviors result from **learning** and **conditioning**
- How nature and nurture interact, not one or the other
