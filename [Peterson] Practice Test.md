- Instinctual drift means that species-specific behaviors (instincts) sometime interfere with and over-ride learning. In this case, cats naturally like to investigate and survey their landscape from high places.

# Question 42

![image-20180803131527444](assets/image-20180803131527444.png)

# Question 44

![image-20180803132038598](assets/image-20180803132038598.png)

- Rehearsal is the intentional repetition of information in order to improve short-term memory.

- Although identical twins share 100 percent of genes, they are not identical beings. Environment does make a difference. However, identical twins are often reared in environments that are relatively similar in terms of intellectual development. Therefore, it is impossible to say what percent of their progress is the result of genes, and what percent is the result of their environments.
