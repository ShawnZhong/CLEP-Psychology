	- MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): generates a strong magnetic field
	- fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging): shows changes in brain activity over time, more detailed images of the brain’s structure,  better accuracy in time, than is possible in PET scans
- Techniques Involving Electrical Activity
	- EEG (Electroencephalography): a measure of a brain’s electrical activity, array of electrodes, overall activity of a person’s brain,

1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.
2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no longer reinforce the previously reinforced response.
3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.
4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.
5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.
