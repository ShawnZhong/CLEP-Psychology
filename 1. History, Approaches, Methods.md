  - **Physiological** and **biochemical** explanation of behavior
  - Genes, neurotransmitters, neurochemicals
- Behavioral approach

    - Learned responses to predictable patterns of **external** **stimuli**
    - People's behaviour is  based on the **environment**

- Humanistic approach
  - Ideas
    - Developed in reaction to Behaviorist and Psychodynamic models

    - Self actualization
  - Carl Rogers
    - People are basically **good**
    - Driven by **unconditional positive regard**
### 1.3. Research Methods
- Experimental
  - **Cause and effect** relationship between two or more variables
  - Types of variables
    - Independent variable
      - The variable being manipulated
      - The “**cause**"
    - Dependent variable
      - The variable being measured for change
      - The “**effect**” 
  - Groups
    - Experimental group
      - Exposed to the “**cause**”
      - Receives the independent variable 
    - Control group
      - Not exposed to the “cause”
      - Receives **no** **treatment** or some treatment that should have no effect
  - Methods
    - Random Assignment
      - Randomly choose who goes into each group
      - **Decrease bias**
    - Blind and Double Blind Study
      - Neither party knows what they are receiving
      - Leads to a more pure research study
    - Placebo and Placebo Effect
      - The sheer belief that I'm taking a medicine will change people's state of mind
- Clinical
  - Case studies
    - **Freud** used this method to develop psychoanalytic theory
    - Hard to apply to a boader population
  - Naturalistic observation
    - Observe the behaviours of our subjects in a naturalistic environment 
    - Agreement among observers
  - Clinical interviews
    - Inter-rater reliability 
- Correlational
  - Ideas
    - **How two variables relate to one another**
    - No manipulation of variables
    - Does **NOT** measure cause and effect
  - Correlation Coefficient
    - A number from -1 to 1
    - Positive Correlation: Correlation Coefficient > 0
    - Negative Correlation: Correlation Coefficient < 0
- Surveys
  - Self-reporting surveys: Subject to **bias**
### 1.4. Ethics in Research
- Participants must be treated **morally** and **respectfully**
- Clearly state the **purpose**, **duration** and **process** of study
- Any possible harm or **adverse effects** should be disclosed
