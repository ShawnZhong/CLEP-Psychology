- Biological rhythms of sleep as measured by EEG

  - Five stages of sleep and differing brain waves

  - Stage 1: Alpha waves

  	- hypnogogic sensations

  - Stage 2: Theta waves

  	- sleep spindles
  	- K-complexes

  - Stage 3: delta waves

- REM rebound

  - **dreams** appear necessary
  - If REM deprived, longer periods will occur

- Theories about Dreaming

  - Freud’s theory of dreams
    - manifest content disguised as latent content

  - Activation-synthesis theory
    - Constructed story to explain images from random neural activation

  - Information-processing model
    - dreams are a way to consolidate information

### 4.2. Hypnosis and meditation

- Hypnosis

	-  induced state of consciousness

	- heightened state of motivation

	- **deep relaxation** and **heightened suggestibility**

	- dissociation: **split in consciousness**

	- promote **relaxation**, **energy** and **compassion**

### 4.3. Psychoactive Drug Effects

- Produce a different state of consciousness by **mimicking**, **inhibiting** or **stimulating** activity of neurotransmitter

- Depressants: alcohol, barbiturates, opiates

- Stimulants: cocaine, amphetamines

- Hallucinogens: LSD, mescaline, psilocybin
