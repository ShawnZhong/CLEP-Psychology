- The main purpose of myelin is to increase the speed at which electrical impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber
- In unmyelinated fibers, electrical impulses (action potentials) travel as continuous waves, but, in myelinated fibers, they "hop" or propagate by saltatory conduction.

- GABA: a neurotransmitter that blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain

- Opponent-process theory

	- a psychological and neurological model that accounts for a wide range of behaviors, including color vision

- Feature detection theory

	- The nervous system sorts or filters complex natural stimuli in order to extract behaviorally relevant cues that have a high probability of being associated with important objects or organisms in their environment, as opposed to irrelevant background or noise.![Image result for feature detection theory](assets/introductory-psychology-sensation-perception-vision-22-728.jpg)

- The self-serving bias

	- A self-serving bias is any cognitive or perceptual process that is distorted by the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem, or the tendency to perceive oneself in an overly favorable manner.
