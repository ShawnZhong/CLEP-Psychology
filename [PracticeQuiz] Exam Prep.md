- Learning and memory are closely related concepts. 
- Learning is the acquisition of skill or knowledge, while memory is the expression of what you’ve acquired. 
- Another difference is the speed with which the two things happen. If you acquire the new skill or knowledge slowly and laboriously, that’s learning. If acquisition occurs instantly, that’s making a memory.
