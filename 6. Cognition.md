- Creativity
	- ability to **generate, create or discover new ideas, solutions and possibilities**
	- divergent thinking-“outside of the box”
	- facet of intelligence-difficult to measure objectively

### 6.2 Language

- Use of words and systematic rules to transmit information (and solve problems)
- Form of communication used uniquely by humans
- Way of getting ideas from one person to another
- Spoken, written or signed
- Components of Language
	- lexicon and grammar
	- phoneme and morphemes combined to form word
	- syntax and semantics used to construct language

### 6.3 Memory

- Sensory memory
	- the memory system that is triggered by the various **senses** that we have
	-  lasts only **brief** moments, seconds and nanoseconds
- Short-term/working memory
	- information left in the mind **long enough to solve problems**
	- Capacity of **7 items +/- 2**
- Long-term memory
	- **extra effort** required to transfer from short-term
	- **Unlimited capacity**

- Mnemonic strategies
	- can be deliberate or unconscious
	- method of getting information into long-term memory or keeping more in short-term
	- rehearsal, chunking, spelling
